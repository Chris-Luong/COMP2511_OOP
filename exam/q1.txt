The example of a "an online call contains a breakout room" is an example
of aggregation. This is because aggregation is when a class contains
another class, which is what we have here. It is not an example of composition
because in composition, the contained class (breakout room) is integral to
the containing class (online call) which is not true, as online calls can
exist without breakout rooms.
