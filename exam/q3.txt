This is valid inheritance because it is a subclass absorbing the
attributes and behaviours of the super class, which is the definition
of inheritance. Additionally, the subclass of UNSWStudent is
modifying one of the behaviours of the super class by throwing an
error if the class time is not available, which we can assume will
be resolved by another method that catches the error. Thus,
the implementation of the Student and UNSWStudent classes is valid
inheritance.
