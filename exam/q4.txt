I would recommend against:

- waiting until the prototype is perfect before testing the software
because this you should practise test-driven development which involves
writing tests before creating prototypes. This way, you are able to see
if you are heading in the right direction as you create your program, rather
than creating a whole prototype and then finding various bugs and issues to fix.

- no-one who practices Agile uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): This is false
because Agile softare development is a process that applies to all programming
languages and paradigms (such as OOP). It is a software engineering practice that
allows you to create strong programs that are constantly improved.
