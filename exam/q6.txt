The most suitable design pattern for making the pizza is the Decorator pattern.
This is because decorators are able to provide a flexible alternative to sub-classing
for extending funcionality. Without using patterns, one could have a sub-class for
every differnt type/variation of pizza and constantly add new sub-classes for
different variations. However, with a Decorator pattern, the objects (pizzas)
can be decorated multiple times in different orders (i.e. different sauces, cheese,
etc.). It will be implemented by having the main abstract component class as the pizza,
then concrete components which are the main types of pizzas (Hawaiian, Meatlovers, Neapolitan
and Vegetarian). Finally, there will be the actual decorator for the cheeses, sauce, meat and
any other toppings which can also calculate the costs.
