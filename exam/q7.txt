The most suitable Design Pattern to model this system would be the Composite design pattern 
since the organisational hierarchy consists of similar smaller hierachies.Here we have
organisational units within organisational units (i.e. Divisions contain Faculties which contain Schools,
all of which have a similar structure).
The primary benefit of using the Composite pattern is that the way the smaller groups are implemented would be
similar to the way the larger head groups are implemented.

We can implement the Composite pattern, by having the UNSW organisational hierarchy being the client, and the Organisational
Units as the components/composites. The Divisions and Faculties are the components that have a head, manager and supporting staff affiliated
with the unit. These employees would be subcomponent or "leaves" of Divisions. Schools would be slightly different to the other Organisational
Units as they are the smallest group and don't contain other Orangisational Units, with some different functionality - the ability to offer courses.
