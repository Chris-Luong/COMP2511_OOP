a) and b)
- Bad variable/method naming: getFriends in WasteBookController finds the number
of friends a person has, returning an int, so this method should be called
getAmountOfFriends or something that would make the return type clearer.
Additionally, people is a list of members so I changed this to members to
distinguish between a member of the network and a person in real life.
- The follow() method in WasteBookController has too much
nesting in its for loop. The second for loop could be extracted to another
method.
- There is a lot of repetition of code that compares people/members which
could be extracted into a method. This was solved by the refactoring from
the previous method.

c)
- Iterator is updated in the methods where a new member is added to the network
or when a member follows another memeber.
